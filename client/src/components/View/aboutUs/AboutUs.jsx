          Using advanced geolocation technology, GreenSpots employs real-time
          data integration to provide accurate and up-to-date information about
          charging stations. Each marker on the map displays key details, such
          as the type of charging connector available (e.g., Type 2, CHAdeMO,
          CCS), the charging speed, and the charging network operator. This
          wealth of information allows users to make informed decisions and plan
          their charging sessions accordingly.
          <br></br>
          GreenSpots offers several filtering options to refine your search
          results. Users can narrow down their choices based on charging speed,
          connector type, and network operator preferences. Additionally, the
          platform incorporates user ratings and feedback, enabling EV owners to
          share their experiences and recommend charging stations based on
          factors such as reliability, accessibility, and amenities.
